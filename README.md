Welcome to your new TanStack Start app!

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
bun install
bun --bun run dev
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
bun --bun run build
bun run start
```

The server must run on Bun: products, orders and staff accounts live in a SQLite database via `bun:sqlite`.

# ORAIA admin

The admin lives at `/admin` (to-do board, orders and payment checks, products & stock, payment accounts, staff).

**First owner account.** There is no public sign-up. Add these to `.env.local`, then restart the server once; the owner account is created on first start and the variables are ignored after that:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=a-long-password   # at least 10 characters
```

**Demo data.** For local testing, `bun run db:seed` adds demo accounts (`owner@oraia.test` / `oraia-owner-2026`, `staff@oraia.test` / `oraia-staff-2026`), two extra products and 16 orders spread across the board, payment methods and payment states. `bun run db:seed --reset` wipes products, orders, payment settings and accounts first. It refuses to run with `NODE_ENV=production`.

Owners add staff from **Admin → Staff**. Staff can run the board, orders and stock; owners can also change payment accounts and staff.

**Data.** Everything is stored under `.data/` (git-ignored):

| Path | Contents | Env override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.data/oraia.sqlite` | products, orders, payment accounts, staff accounts | `DATABASE_PATH` |
| `.data/uploads/products`, `payments` | product photos and QR codes (public) | `UPLOAD_DIR` |
| `.data/uploads/proofs` | customers' payment screenshots (staff only) | `UPLOAD_DIR` |

Back up `.data/` regularly. The database is created and seeded with the starter catalog and sample payment accounts on first run; replace the sample QR codes from **Admin → Payments** before taking real orders.

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Remove `@tailwindcss/vite` and `tailwindcss` from `package.json`


## Deploy with Nitro

This project uses Nitro as a generic server adapter, so it can run on any Node-compatible host.

```bash
npm run build
node dist/server/index.mjs
```

The build output is a self-contained Node server. To deploy, push the `dist/` directory to your host (Render, Fly.io, your own VPS, etc.) and run the server command above.

For host-specific presets (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, AWS Lambda, etc.) and tuning, see https://v3.nitro.build/deploy.


## Solid-UI

This installation of Solid-UI follows the manual instructions but was modified to work with Tailwind V4.

To install the components, run the following command (this install button):

```bash
bunx --bun solidui-cli@latest add button
```


## Setting up Better Auth

1. Generate and set the `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable in your `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   bunx --bun @better-auth/cli secret
   ```

2. Visit the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com) to unlock the full potential of authentication in your app.

### Adding a Database (Optional)

Better Auth can work in stateless mode, but to persist user data, add a database:

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  }),
  // ... rest of config
});
```

Then run migrations:

```bash
bunx --bun @better-auth/cli migrate
```



## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/solid-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/solid/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/solid-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/solid-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      <For each={data().results}>
        {(person) => <li>{person.name}</li>}
      </For>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).




## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. The following scripts are available:


```bash
bun --bun run lint
bun --bun run format
bun --bun run check
```
